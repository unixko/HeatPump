Note: integrations are just example code. They are not a part of the library. I personally have no use for them, nor understand them.
If you have issues with these examples, I suggest you join the gitter chat and ask for help there. someone in the chat can help and is 
probably more than willing to update them via pull requests.

do not open issues for non library related issues!
